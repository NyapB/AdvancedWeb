            <h2><a name="yo">Why is it essential for a backend developer to have a portfolio?</a></h2> 
                  <br>
              <p>We can boil it down to this: it’s a great way to showcase your skills, highlight your achievements, and attract the attention of business clients or potential employers.
                      <br>
                  In our current world, backend developers can find success as technology company employees or hire their services out as freelancers. Whichever route you take to apply your skills, having a portfolio allows you to showcase your skills and credentials to get access to backend developer jobs.
                      <br>
                  It is also a way to stand out from your peers and competitors while sharing your learning journey and passion for the field.</p>
          </div>
 
          <div>
             <h2><a name="yo1">What tools and resources do you need to build a backend developer portfolio?</a></h2>
 
             <p>Now, we get to building a backend developer portfolio. How do you do it? What tools and resources can you use?</p>
          </div>
 
          <div>
             <h3>1. A platform to build your website</h3>
 
             <p>
                 You can use a website builder or template to get started. Even though what a backend developer does is abstracted from the front-facing part of the website users interact with, you must make it an appealing selection that draws in the viewer instantly. <br>
 
                  Building the website could also showcase your web development skills over a wide range of fields, further solidifying your abilities in the eyes of potential employers.<br>
                  
                  Some examples of platforms you can use include Kamatera, Adobe Portfolio, Behance, Wix, Dribble, Coroflot, Crevado, and more
             </p>
          </div>
         
          <div>
            <h3>2. Web frameworks</h3>
            <p>
              Every back end developer uses frameworks as a standard way to build and deploy web apps. They include APIs, modules, libraries, and so on, meant to simplify everyday tasks like authentication, routing, and database access.
                <br>
                Some programming language frameworks you can use for this include Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Django. They can help you create a portfolio website that showcases your backend development skills and knowledge.
              </p>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>3. Code editors</h3>
            <p> 
              You will need code editors to help you write, edit, and debug code. You can access syntax highlighting, testing tools, error checking, code completion, and more. Some well-known editors include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.
              <br>
              Code editors can help you write and edit code for your portfolio website and showcase your coding style and proficiency.
            </p>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>4. Version control systems</h3>
            <p> 
              With version control, you can showcase your organization and documentation skills on your portfolio. Tools like Git, Mercurial, and SVN can help you create, merge, and revert branches, collaborate with other developers, and back up your work.
            </p>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>5. Hosting services</h3>
            <p>Hosting services provide the space and resources for your website or app to run online. Depending on your budget and needs, you can choose from different plans and features. Some examples of hosting services include AWS, Heroku, and DigitalOcean.  </p>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h2><a name="yo2">Top 8 examples of portfolios for backend developers</a></h2>
            <p> Just like we have done with our guide to creating your software engineer portfolio with examples, we are going to dive into some of the websites that show the most promise when it comes to showcasing what you can do as a backend developer. <br> 
              Let’s dive in.
            </p>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>1. Lokkee Studios</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec3.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The website is created using fullpage.js by Killian, who invites us to dig into his universe and see his services on the homepage. There is a ‘Hit me up’ button for easy contact and plenty of past projects and reviews from past clients. You get all that in one page, plus pricing, including a custom option to fit your budget.</p>
            <p>
              At the bottom, you can find source code for the backend projects he’s done, giving visitors a single-page summary of what they need to know.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>2. Dejan Markovic</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec4.jpg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>As soon as you open the website, the words ‘Hello. I am Dejan’ slide into view, with the developer’s photo to the side. Hovering over the words reveals a hidden menu leading to the Work, About, and Contacts pages.</p>
            <p>
              Some projects showcased in the portfolio include a countdown app, a digital product design platform, a platform for achieving personal goals, an app for children with special needs, and a selection of freelance projects.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>3. Cory Hughart</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec5.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p> Cory is a full-stack developer with plenty of expertise to showcase. After a confident introduction that assures us he can make ‘just about anything,’ we move on to his latest projects and the option to view them all: his resume (where he details employment), skills (across development and design), and finally, his education. </p>
            <p>
              Hughart uses his unique tone and voice to communicate all this information in a way that welcomes visitors in and encourages them to trust that he knows what he is talking about, with the background and projects to back it up. 
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>4. Pierre Nel</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec6.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Pierre Nel is a web developer specializing in design, frontend and backend development, utilizing React, Vue, Angular, Laravel, WordPress, and more technologies. He uses a simple dark theme and smooth scrolling effect on his website.</p>
            <p>
              It starts with who he is and what he does. Scrolling lower reveals recent work with companies like PBJ Management, Acierta Retail, Hot Pottery, and more. His previous work for Cartoon Network, BBC, Annie Lennox, and other recognizable names further boosts his credibility.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>5. Daniel Fischer</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec7.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>With a consistent design, Fischer presents the most pertinent information in one page. There’s a menu to navigate to Education/Work, Projects, Skills, About Me, and Contact Pages. The homepage details who he is, his hobbies and interests, educational achievements, solo projects, group projects, and skills. </p>
            <p>
              Fischer’s website makes it easy for any visitor to find out what they need to hire him. The design can inspire you to make something as succinct and easy to take in as this while adding links to your backend projects for easy viewing.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>6. Timmy O’Mahonyc</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec8.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Timmy’s website is simple, as many backend developer portfolios tend to be. It does more explaining than it does showing but provides plenty of links to find the work he’s done and how complex it is. As a full-stack developer, O’Mahony can work on the front- or backend.</p>
            <p>
              On the homepage, you get the intro, an invitation to reach out, reviews from past clients, a list of brands he has worked with, and recent projects and work. What’s more, Timmy further flexes his technical abilities through a blog section based on his recent challenges/tasks and how he managed to get through them.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>7. Matthew Williams</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec9.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Matthew may be a frontend developer more than anything, but his website design is worth learning from. You can quickly view the home page, about page, portfolio, blog, and contact options on the same page. </p>
            <p>
              t’s the design that we are interested in. While backend projects are less about what you can see, your website isn’t. As such, creating a website as attractive and intuitive as this is a great way to sell yourself as a backend developer to recruiters/employees who may not be all about the technical side of you.
            </p>
          </div>
           </div>

           <div>
            <h3>8. Rafael Caferati</h3>
            <div>
              <img
              class="im1"
              src="pictures/pec10.jpeg">
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Rafael Caferati’s website is arresting. The introduction appears as if carved by an invisible laser onto the page. It doesn’t take long to spot the button saying ‘Destroy Website’; of course, you press it. It’s a game! In the style of Space Invaders! What? There’s even a scoreboard and leaderboard. That’s a show of force from the backend right there.</p>
            <p>
              Once your excitement subsides, you start to notice just how well-thought-out the portfolio is. You can access his about, portfolio, labs, and contact pages by scrolling right or using the menu in the top right corner.
